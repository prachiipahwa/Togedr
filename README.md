# Togedr: Do more, Togedr.
*A Real-Time Activity Matching Web Application*

**Togedr** is a utility-first web application designed to connect users for real-time, nearby activities without the pressure of long-term social connections. It enables users to post or join nearby short-term activities with filters for time, location, and interest.
